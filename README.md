# Code snippets

#### This is the code snippets github page of mine, where I store all relevant useful techniques, algorithms, and even technology codes for reference. All of these codes are by no means are mine, they are collectively gathered from many different sites like [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and suggestions from my mentors and friends. Feel free to use. :nerd_face:
